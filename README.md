# Tree Segmentation Project

This repository contains the code for the master thesis titled "*Enhancing Tree Segmentation on Large Forest Point Clouds with Synthetic Data*"

## Data Generation

The synthetic forest generation workflow is available at:

https://gitlab-ce.gwdg.de/hpc-team-public/synforest

## Tree Segmentation

There is a directory for each of the four segmentation methods: watershed, Dalponte, AMS3D, and SGPN: `cls_watershed/`, `cls_dalponte/`, `cls_ams3d/`, and `SGPN/`, respectively.

Each directory has a `test.py` and `metrics.py` file to run the test with or without visualization, respectively.

To train SGPN, run `SPGN/train.py <config>` where `<config>` is the basename of the config file under `SGPN/config/`.
